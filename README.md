# Spring-LOTR-Characters-Project
Why are we doing this -
This project is to help us apply everything we've learnt to a real project

How I expected the challenge to go -
I expected the challenge to be doable, but I did expect the tests to be quite difficult

What went well / What didn't go as planned -
The service mockito test went better than expected, however I was stuck on the controller tests for a while,
but I have now got the hang of it and understand it a lot more

Possible improvements for future revisions of the project - 
I will be making a fork of this project where I will hopefully try to add more tables to and database relations,
maybe some more service methods, and maybe even some sort of front end
